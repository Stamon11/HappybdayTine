Dear Tine,

I am writing to you one last time to tell you my truth, calmly, once and for all.


---

A true loving woman:
Takes care of her man herself.
Does not delegate her role to friends.
Does not run away by asking others to ‘watch over’ the one she loves.
Does not talk about ‘with or without me’ to the man she truly loves.

Your behaviour proves that your love was conditional, immature and probably selfish.
You did not love me deeply, you loved what I gave you, how I made you feel.


---

I loved you deeply. Intensely.
I loved you with everything I had.
I waited for you. Hoped for you. Endured. Supported.
I believed in you. I believed in us.
Even in silence, even in absence.

But today I have to face reality:
You were never there, physically present.
Not in the good times.
Not in the bad times.
Not with your voice.
Not with your body.
Not with your actions.

You said you loved me.
But you never took that train yourself.
You never picked up the phone, no calls in 9 months.
You never joined the life we said we wanted together.

I see clearly now.


---

No financial investment. You shared nothing.
You sleep until 12 or 1 p.m., with no desire to live life to the fullest.
I am alone, with my motivation. Alone. Not as a couple.


---

You took the suspenders and didn't tell me about it.
You didn't respect our sexual connection.


---

The ball of coke:
See the video.
A hidden ball of cocaine?
If it fell from your clothes, your hair or your hands,
it could indicate that you had hidden cocaine on you.
This raises questions about your sincerity.
It could explain your financial problems, your anxiety, your mood swings, and your contradictions.


---

The USB stick I gave you so we could mix together?
You accepted it even though you knew you didn't mix with a controller.
You knew you were never going to use it.
But you accepted it anyway.


---

You weren't a woman in love.
You were seeking attention and male validation.
You needed the attention of others, flattery, even if it meant betraying what we had.

Example message:

> ‘Great you re-uploaded this set! I really appreciate it, so thank you. Also thank you for your message on my profile... 🙌🙏🔛’



This shows a difficulty in creating emotional exclusivity.
I want a woman who focuses on us, not a woman who is distracted.


---

You sold me the image of a sincere, fragile woman.
But behind that, you may have been using your body, your charm, and much more,
to get what you wanted behind the scenes.

Your lack of involvement betrayed one thing:
Your total lack of true love.

You were there to fill an inner void.
To take advantage of my generosity.
Of my pure love.


---

I'm not looking for a fantasy.
I'm looking for a real woman, present, grounded,
who chooses her man as a matter of course.


---

You say you've been cheated on twice.
But have you thought about why?
Maybe because you never really invest yourself.
You give the illusion of love, but you never build anything.


---

I even wondered if you had a double life.
Your nights are ambiguous. You're hiding something. You know it.

I don't have Othello syndrome.
I've never been cheated on.
But I can sense it. My intuition spoke.
And that triggered our argument.

I haven't hidden anything from you in nine months.
Not a single message.
Nothing.

And you?
How did you know in a matter of hours that Van Ton Los was married with two children?
It's not written anywhere... so?


---

I'm not a second choice.
I'm the one and only. The only one.
The best of the best when I love.
And I want to be respected as I respect others.


---

I think back to the day you shouted at Serge:

> ‘No, no, not that, I want to see him!’
And the next day:
‘I'm in lockdown.’
And that's when I understood.




---

I waited for you. Supported you. Defended you. Loved you.

And you?
You fed off attention on social media.
You wrote to other men.
You looked elsewhere for what you said you wanted here.

And you made me look like the crazy one.


---

But it was you... who never got on that train.


---

I'm not judging you.
I understand your wounds.
But I no longer accept carrying the weight of a love meant for two on my own.

I will no longer beg for a love that doubts.


---

You gave me a few gifts:
Photos. A salt lamp. A ring. A candle. A card.
But never your whole body, your time, your real investment.


---

You had three months to save 40 or 50 euros.
You knew I would take care of everything afterwards.
You didn't even make a gesture.
Not a single one.

That's not love.


---

I wanted to come to Alkmaar.
To kneel at your door.
But I understood: you would have closed the door on me.


---

And now a voice speaks to me. The voice of truth:
You were never there.


---

So today, I'm stopping here.

I gave you my love.
My energy.
My soul.

But I can't keep sacrificing myself anymore.


---

You didn't respect me.
You didn't accept me.
And even if what I saw was real,
what I hoped for was not.


---

And now I see it:
You were not my wife.
You were a dream.
A projection.
An intensity.

But not a presence.
Not a companion.


---

I give you back your freedom.
I take back mine.
I am getting back on my feet.
I am taking back my light.

And you,
if one day you want to join me,
know that it will be up to you to walk.
Not with words.
Not with silences.
But with your heart. Your body. Your commitment.

Then you will know where to find me.
If it is not too late...


---

But on that day,
come for real.
With your soul.
Your courage.

Because I need a different woman,
one who will be by my side, in real life.


---

Otherwise... Farewell.


---

I thank you for all the good times we had together.
I wish you all the best in your life.
And may you be happy.

Happy birthday.

May each day bring you peace
and light with your Mixcloud guys, and especially Van Ton Los ;-).

Take care of yourself.

Patrice
