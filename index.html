      I’m writing to you one last time to tell you my truth, calmly, once and for all.

---

A truly loving woman:
Takes care of her man herself.
Does not delegate her role to friends.
Does not run away asking others to "watch" the one she loves.
Does not speak of "with or without me" to the man she truly loves.

Your behavior shows that your love was conditional, immature, and probably selfish.
You didn’t love me deeply — you loved what I gave you, how I made you feel.

---

I loved you deeply. Intensely.
I loved you with everything I had.
I waited. Hoped. Supported. Stood by you.
I believed in you. I believed in us.
Even in the silence, even in the absence.

But today I have to face reality:
You were never really there, physically.
Not in the good times.
Not in the bad times.
Not with your voice.
Not with your body.
Not through actions.

You said you loved me.
But you never took the train by yourself.
Never picked up the phone, not a single call in 9 months.
Never joined the life we claimed to want together.

Now I see clearly.

---

No financial investment. You shared nothing.
You sleep until noon or 1 PM, without hunger for life.
I’m alone, with my motivation. Alone. Not in a duo.

---

You wore garter belts and didn’t tell me.
You didn’t respect our sexual bond.

---

The cocaine pellet:
Watch the video.
A hidden pellet of cocaine?
If it fell from your clothes, hair or hands,
it could indicate you hid cocaine on you.
It raises questions about your honesty.
It could explain your financial issues, anxiety, mood swings, and contradictions.

---

The USB stick I gave you to mix together?
You accepted it even though you knew you didn’t use a controller.
You knew you’d never use it.
But you accepted it anyway.

---

You were not a loving woman.
You were seeking male attention and validation.
You needed others’ gazes and compliments, even if it meant betraying what we had.

Example message:

> "Great you re-uploaded this set! I really appreciate it, so thank you. Also thank you for your message on my profile... 🙌🙏🔛"

That shows a difficulty creating emotional exclusivity.
I want a woman who focuses on us — not one scattered.

---

You sold me the image of a sincere, fragile woman.
But behind it, perhaps you used your body, your charm, and more,
to get what you wanted in the shadows.

Your lack of involvement betrayed only one thing:
Your total lack of real love.

You were there to fill an inner void.
To benefit from my generosity.
From my pure love.

---

I’m not looking for a fantasy.
I’m looking for a real, grounded woman,
who chooses her man as an obvious choice.

---

You say you were cheated on twice.
But did you reflect on why?
Maybe because you never truly invest.
You give the illusion of love, but never build.

---

I even wondered if you had a double life.
Your nights are ambiguous. You’re hiding something. You know it.

I don’t have Othello syndrome.
I’ve never been cheated on.
But I feel it. My intuition spoke.
And that’s what triggered our dispute.

I hid nothing in 9 months.
Not one message.
Nothing.

And you?
How did you know within hours that Van Ton Los was married with two kids?
It’s written nowhere… so?

---

I’m not a second choice.
I’m the only one.
The very best when I love.
And I want to be respected like I respect others.

---

I remember the day you yelled at Serge:
> "No, no, not that, I want to see him!"
And the next day:
"I’m confined."
And that’s when I understood.

---

I waited for you. Supported you. Defended you. Loved you.

And you?
You fed off attention online.
You wrote to other men.
You searched elsewhere for what you said you wanted here.

And you made me look crazy.

---

But it’s you… who never took that train.

---

I don’t judge you.
I understand your wounds.
But I can no longer carry a two-person love on my own.

I will no longer beg for a love that doubts.

---

You offered me a few gestures:
Photos. A salt lamp. A ring. A candle. A card.
But never your full body, your time, your real commitment.

---

You had three months to save €40 or €50.
You knew I would cover everything else afterward.
You didn’t even make one gesture.
Not one.

That is not love.

---

I wanted to come to Alkmaar.
To kneel at your door.
But I understood: you would’ve closed it.

---

Now a voice speaks to me. The voice of truth:
You were never really there.

---

So today, I stop here.

I gave you my love.
My energy.
My soul.

But I can no longer keep sacrificing myself.

---

You didn’t respect me.
You didn’t include me.
And even if what I saw was real,
what I hoped for wasn’t.

---

And now I see it:
You weren’t my woman.
You were a dream.
A projection.
An intensity.

But not a presence.
Not a partner.

---

I give you back your freedom.
I take mine back.
I rise again.
I reclaim my light.

And you,
if one day you want to join it,
know that it will be your turn to walk.
Not with words.
Not with silence.
But with your heart. Your body. Your commitment.

Then you’ll know where to find me.
If it’s not too late…

---

But that day,
come in real life.
With your soul.
Your courage.

Because I must have a different woman,
who will be by my side — in real life.

---

Otherwise… Goodbye.

---

Thank you for all the good moments we shared.
I wish you the best in your life.
And that you may be happy.

Happy birthday.

May each day bring you peace
and light with your Mixcloud guys — especially Van Ton Los ;-)

Take care of yourself.

Patrice
